# RESULTS_v2 — STATUS (v3.1 interface-composition computational program)
**Thesis (ARTICLE_PLAN_v3):** the in-situ POSS-cured poly-APC Mg-anode interphase is **Si-rich, Al-poor, surface-confined**, which **suppresses Al co-deposition** and makes Mg plating reversible (CE ~100% vs bare 27%). Transport is **not** the discriminator (GITT + MD agree). **No fluorine story.**
**Node:** EPYC CPU (192 core) — DFT (G16/ORCA) + AIMD/periodic (CP2K 2025.1). GPU/MLFF tickets (T5,T16,T17) are the other node.
**Started:** 2026-06-18 (this session). Branch `main`.

Transport NULL confirmed for the **canonical 4-POSS gel** (D ×4.4, t₊=0.50, f 0.046→0.13).

## v2→v3 reconciliation (the scientific crux, honest)
The v2 master report concluded "**not** redox chemistry" (four matched nulls + retracted Cl-abstraction): the **dominant** anion [AlPh₂Cl₂]⁻ reduces at **phenyl**, not Al. The **new ToF-SIMS data** (poly Al-ions ×0.02–0.5, confined ~90 nm vs bare ~350 nm) shows Al **does** co-deposit on bare — so the v3 task is to prove *which* channel deposits Al and *how poly blocks it*, without contradicting the v2 nulls. The resolution being tested:
- **Al that deposits comes from the Al-centred channel:** the minority **AlCl₄⁻** (only anion that reduces *at Al*, spin +1.14) **and** reductive decomposition of reduced phenyl-anions (Al–Cl cleavage → 83% Al-spin radical → Al⁰). The bulk-speciation nulls do **not** preclude this minority/decomposition route.
- **Poly blocks it two ways:** (i) **coordination/transport gating** — the cured network de-pairs + segregates the Al-anion ~7 Å from the front, 4.2× slower (v2 result, = ticket C2/T5/T6 kinetic route); (ii) **a Si-rich passivating SEI** (T7/T8) electronically blocks continued reduction, where the bare Al⁰/alloy SEI is electronically leaky (→ self-discharge, CE 27%).
This keeps the honest spine (transport not the bulk discriminator; the win is interfacial-compositional) and turns v2's gating result into the *mechanism* of Al exclusion.
